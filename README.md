By the end of this project, I’ve gained the ability to explain many core concepts of JavaScript programming without needing to rely on Google. I now understand why JavaScript is such an amazing language—it's incredibly versatile and powers most of the dynamic features we see on modern websites. I’ve learned how to run JavaScript scripts using Node.js and how to declare variables using let and const, while also understanding the differences between them and var in terms of scope and reassignment. I can identify and work with all the basic data types in JavaScript, including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, null, and undefined. I’m comfortable using if and if...else statements to control program logic and know how to use comments to document my code effectively. Assigning values to variables is second nature now, and I’ve practiced writing loops using both while and for, as well as using break and continue to manage how those loops run. I understand how to define and use functions, what happens when a function doesn’t have a return statement, and how variable scope works in different contexts. I’ve also become confident with arithmetic operations and how to use them in my code. Working with dictionaries (or objects) to store and access data has become more intuitive, and I’ve learned how to structure my code better by importing functions and variables from other files. This project has laid a solid foundation for me as a JavaScript developer and prepared me to tackle more complex programming tasks with confidence
